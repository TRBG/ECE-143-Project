# Temperature Trends Analysis
This folder contains the python script files that performs temperature trends analysis over several regions.
- trends_analysis_global.py: for global temperature trends analysis
- trends_analysis_equator_deep_day_deep_night.py: for temperature analysis in the equator region
- trends_analysis_north_sea_deep_day.py: for temperature analysis in the north sea region
- trends_analysis_california_equator_deep_day_deep_night.py: for temperature analysis in the California region

# Data Needed: 

All the scripts use the datafile: all_data_depth_0_temp_nan_free_coordinates.csv (check the Data Wrangling folder for details on how to acquire this file from the raw data or the main repo README to know how to download it from Google Drive)
This file  contains the cleaned data (with no nan temperature data) at depth = 0 (surface measurements).
