# ECE-143-Project
This repo contains the code, data, and approach for the ECE 143 Project at UCSD
In order to complete this project, we used following databases
# Datasets: 

### * NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information [ WOD (World Ocean Database )](https://www.nodc.noaa.gov/OC5/SELECT/dbsearch/dbsearch.html)
      	 3.2 million Casts
      	 250 Thousand Biological Casts
This database was acquired through a request by form from the provided website.
 
Data for non_biological ocean variables including temperature, salinity, oxygen, Phosphate, pH, nitrate etc.

### * BCO-DMO (Biological & Chemistry Oceanography Data Management Office) [JeDI](https://www.bco-dmo.org/dataset/526852)

Data for jellyfish and zooplanktons
### * NOAA Coast Watch Environmental Data [wocecpr](https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/info/wocecpr/index.html)
Data for zooplanktons
This database was acquired from the server using following method
### [ERDDAP (Environmental Research Divisions Data Access Program)](https://upwell.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/index.html)
ERDDAP is a data server that gives you a simple, consistent way to download subsets of scientific datasets in common file formats and make graphs and maps. This ERDDAP installation makes all of the datasets in the NOAA-wide UAF THREDDS catalog and many additional datasets available via ERDDAP.
